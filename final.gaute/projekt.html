                                Taxes are monetary contributions that citizens pay to the government. They are an important source of income to cover public
                                expenses (Store Norske Leksikon, 2014).
                                <span class="dotting1">..</span>
                                <span class="dtext1 d-none"> These expenses are for example public health care, free education, social welfare and care
                                    for the elderly.
                                    <br> These are services that are part of the (Norwegian) welfare system, and each year they
                                    cost the public great amounts of money. Therefore it is essential that everyone contributes
                                    and pay their share (Skatteetaten, 2017). The tax principle is based on everyone paying
                                    according to their ability and receiving benefits by their needs. Those with a high income,
                                    which determines ability, pay more than those with a lower income.</span>

                                This fall there was a government election in Norway. As a part of the election campaigns several discussions about taxes
                                arose. Where some parties and politicians want to cut taxes, others want to increase them.
                                <br>A few weeks later, the national budget was presented to the public. The national budget is
                                an estimate of the country’s predicted income and expenses for the coming year, and also
                                determines how the government wants to spend future income and how they plan to prioritize
                                between predicted expenses (Thomassen & Stoltz, 2017).
                                <span class="dotting2">..</span>
                                <span class="dtext2 d-none">
                                    <br>
                                    <br> In 2014 there were estimations that about 150 billion NOK were not paid in taxes as
                                    a result of a black labor market valued to 420 billion NOK, which was 14 % of the gross
                                    national product (Vestreng, 2014).
                                    <br> These are unpaid contributions that could be valuable to public goods and services.
                                    Furthermore, workers that don’t pay taxes don’t have the same security and rights, if
                                    any, as those who do. This includes, among other things, the right to retirement money,
                                    sick leave and minimum wage.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> We see this as a challenge because our general impression is that there is a lot of
                                    complaining about taxes, while we believe very few would be happy if we had to pay to
                                    put our children through school or every time we needed to see the doctor. Furthermore,
                                    there seems to be little awareness of the consequences of black labor, both for the individual
                                    worker and for the society as a whole (Steen, 2016).</p>

                                We hypothesize that many don’t fully understand that the welfare society is financed through taxes, and that everyone needs
                                to contribute in order for this to function. Countries have gone bankrupt with the lack of
                                tax income as a contributing case/reason for this. Therefore, we want to create an educational
                                webpage where one can see how the tax money is spent and how much is actually necessary to
                                have a functional society.

                                    <br> Our goal is to create a better understanding of the concept of taxes, why we pay them
                                    and how the money is distributed. By visualizing how our tax money is spent, we believe
                                    that it will be easier for people to make informed choices, for example as for what they
                                    want to vote for in elections. One way we aim to do this is by giving a graphic presentation
                                    of the national budget, and to show how different parties aim to allocate the government’s
                                    income between different posts. Furthermore, we hope that this tool will increase understanding
                                    of why it is necessary to pay taxes, and perhaps create a stronger incentive to do so.

                                Our interactive charts would help visualize the typical income and expenditures of a government and shed light on how taxes
                                are spent. The charts would be divided into categories healthcare or transportation. Pressing
                                these categories would animate charts with subcategories, such as healthcare research and
                                supplies. The charts would display detailed information on the spending in each category.
                                The user would also be able to compare data from different countries and see how the different
                                governments collect and distribute funds. Charts for tax income and national budgets are
